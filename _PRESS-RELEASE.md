# Music Adventure! #
## Encouraging curiosity in music ##

Music Adventure makes finding new music fun. We start with music you love, and we help you to find music you've never heard before, that you might love even more!

There are many streaming services, each with their own algorithm to play you music, and each with their own stable of artists and songs they've licensed. Great, but what if there's a band you'll absolutely love that the streaming service hasn't licensed? You'll never hear them. Bummer.

Music Adventure uses community-based services to find and play you music: this means we're not beholden to record labels, or to the limits of what we can license. This means we can help you find your favourite music without restriction.

  > "If Music Adventure was a lady, I would marry her today." - Neville Challinger, Music Adventure junior vice-president.

Getting started is easy: just enter an artist/band/composer whose music you love, we'll take care of the rest!

  > "Sweet tunes quieten the bloodscreams in my head. I'm scared the bloodscreams will return, I'm not strong enough to hold them off." - Abigail Watson, terrified Music Adventure user.

So free yourself from the shackles of a streaming service and explore all the music in the world: come on a Music Adventure with us today at www.music-adventure.com.
